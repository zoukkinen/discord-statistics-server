npm run dev

# Build TypeScript in watch mode (separate terminal)
npm run dev:build
```

### Project Structure

```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Your Discord bot token | Required |
| `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` | Your Discord server ID | Required |
| `WEB_PORT` | Port for the web dashboard | 3000 |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | Path to SQLite database file | ./data/discord_stats.db |

## üìà Data Collection

The bot collects the following data every 2 minutes:
- Total member count
- Online member count
- Games being played and player counts

Real-time event tracking:
- Individual game session start/end times (immediate via Discord presence events)
- Member join/leave events (immediate)

All data is stored locally in an SQLite database.

### Discord API Rate Limits & Performance

**Current Optimized Settings:**
- **Stats Collection**: Every 2 minutes (down from 5 minutes)
- **Dashboard Updates**: Every 15 seconds (down from 30 seconds)  
- **Game Activity**: Real-time via Discord events (no polling)

**Discord Rate Limits:**
- Guild data fetching: ~50 requests per 10 seconds per bot
- We use only 1-2 API calls every 2 minutes, well within limits
- Presence data is received via WebSocket events (real-time, no rate limit)

**Further Optimizations Possible:**
- Could reduce to 1 minute intervals if needed (still within rate limits)
- Real-time presence events ensure immediate game tracking
- Member join/leave events are also real-time

## üéØ Assembly Summer 2025

This project is specifically designed for the Assembly summer 2025 event. The dashboard features Assembly-themed styling and is optimized for tracking gaming communities during the event.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not responding:**
- Check that the bot token is correct
- Verify the bot has been invited to your server
- Ensure the bot has the required permissions

**Web dashboard not loading:**
- Check that port 3000 is not being used by another application
- Verify the bot is running without errors
- Check the console for any error messages

**No data showing:**
- Wait a few minutes for the bot to collect initial data
- Check that users are online and playing games
- Verify the Discord server ID is correct

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### Windows WSL Issues
```bash
# If Docker commands are slow:
make wsl-setup

# If you get permission errors:
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/project

# If builds are slow, enable BuildKit:
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1
```

#### macOS Issues
```bash
# If you get architecture errors on Apple Silicon:
make build-multiplatform

# If containers don't start:
docker system prune -f
make build
```

#### Windows (without WSL) Issues
```cmd
REM If you get "docker-compose not found":
docker compose up --build

REM If port 3000 is in use:
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
REM Kill the process using the port

REM For better performance, consider using WSL:
wsl --install
```

#### Linux Issues
```bash
# If you get permission errors:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Then logout and login again

# If builds fail with memory errors:
docker system prune -f
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For WSL Users
- Use named volumes (already configured)
- Enable BuildKit: `make wsl-setup`
- Store project files in WSL filesystem, not Windows

#### For Apple Silicon Users
- Multi-arch builds are automatic
- Use `make build-multiplatform` for explicit cross-platform builds

#### For All Platforms
- Use `make prod` for production deployment with nginx
- Monitor with `make status` and `make health`
- Regular backups with `make backup`

### Logs

The bot outputs detailed logs to help with debugging:
- `‚úÖ` Success messages
- `üìä` Statistics collection
- `üéÆ` Game activity changes
- `‚ùå` Error messages
