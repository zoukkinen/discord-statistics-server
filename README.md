## üöÄ Quick Start

### Container-First Approach

This project is designed to run exclusively in containers for maximum compatibility and ease of deployment. All development and production environments use Docker containers.

**Cross-platform compatibility:**
- ‚úÖ Windows (with WSL recommended)
- ‚úÖ Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL)
- ‚úÖ macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- ‚úÖ Linux (AMD64 and ARM64)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux)
- Docker Compose
- A Discord bot token
- Your Discord server ID

**Quick deployment:**
```bash
# All platforms (Linux/macOS/WSL/Windows):
make setup      # Create .env file
# Edit .env with your Discord credentials
make dev        # Start development environment
```

### Platform-Specific Instructions

#### All Platforms (Unified Process)
```bash
# 1. Setup environment
make setup

# 2. Configure your Discord credentials
# Edit the .env file with your bot token and server ID
nano .env  # or use any text editor

# 3. Start the application
make dev   # Development mode
make prod  # Production mode (with nginx)
```

The Makefile automatically detects your platform (Windows/WSL, macOS Intel/ARM64, Linux) and applies the appropriate optimizations.

### Option 2: Docker Deployment (Manual)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A Discord bot token
- Your Discord server ID

**Manual deployment:**
```bash
# 1. Setup environment
make setup
# Edit .env file with your Discord credentials

# 2. Start in development mode
make dev

# 3. Or start in production mode (with nginx)
make prod
```

**Available Make commands:**
```bash
make help              # Show all available commands
make platform-info     # Show platform information

# Setup
make setup             # Create .env file from template
make validate-env      # Validate environment configuration

# Development
make dev               # Start in development mode
make up                # Start containers
make down              # Stop containers
make restart           # Restart all services

# Production
make prod              # Start in production mode (with nginx)
make build             # Build Docker images

# Monitoring
make logs              # View all logs
make logs-bot          # View Discord bot logs
make status            # Check service status

# Database Operations
make backup            # Backup PostgreSQL database
make restore           # Restore from backup (specify BACKUP_FILE=filename)
make list-backups      # List available backups
make sync-production   # Sync with Heroku production data

# Cleanup
make clean             # Remove containers, images, and data (destructive)
make clean-soft        # Remove containers only (keeps data)
```

**Alternative: Manual Container Setup**

If you prefer to set up containers manually without the automated scripts:

1. **Clone and setup the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd discord-statistics-server
   ```

2. **Create environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Configure your environment:**
   Edit `.env` file with your Discord bot token and server ID:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_discord_server_id_here
   WEB_PORT=3000
   ```

## üéØ Event Management

This tracker supports **dynamic event management** through an intuitive admin interface! You can create, manage, and switch between multiple events without restarting the system.

### üÜï Admin Interface (Recommended)

**Easy Setup**: After installation, navigate to `/admin` in your browser:
- **Local Development**: http://localhost:5173/admin
- **Production**: https://yourdomain.com/admin

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Create new events with custom dates and descriptions
- ‚úÖ Switch active events instantly
- ‚úÖ View event history and statistics
- ‚úÖ Edit existing event details
- ‚úÖ No server restart required

### üìã Legacy Environment Configuration (Deprecated)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: Environment variables are now deprecated in favor of the admin interface. They're kept for backwards compatibility and initial setup only.

For the initial default event, the system uses Assembly Summer 2025 configuration. If you need to override this during first setup, you can still use:

```env
# ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED: Use /admin interface instead
EVENT_NAME=Your Event Name 2025
EVENT_START_DATE=2025-12-01T09:00:00Z
EVENT_END_DATE=2025-12-05T18:00:00Z
EVENT_TIMEZONE=Europe/London
EVENT_DESCRIPTION=Discord activity tracking for Your Event Name 2025
```

### üé® Multiple Event Support

With the new system, you can:
- **Track multiple events** over time
- **Compare statistics** between different events
- **Maintain historical data** for all your events
- **Switch contexts** easily without data loss

**Note:** The dashboard will automatically update its title, dates, and all references to use your configured event details!

4. **Start the containers:**
   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL and the app in development mode
   docker-compose up
   
   # Or start in background
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Open the dashboard:**
   Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Container-First Development Workflow

All development happens in Docker containers for consistency and isolation:

```bash
# Start development environment
make dev

# View logs in real-time
make logs

# Open shell in container
make shell

# Stop environment
make down
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Complete setup from scratch
make quick-start          # Creates .env and starts development

# Daily development workflow
make dev                  # Start development environment  
make logs                 # Monitor all logs
make logs-bot             # Monitor Discord bot only
make status               # Check container status

# Database operations
make backup               # Backup local PostgreSQL
make restore BACKUP_FILE=filename.sql
make sync-production      # Get latest production data
```

```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Your Discord bot token | Required |
| `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` | Your Discord server ID | Required |
| `WEB_PORT` | Port for the web dashboard | 3000 |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection URL | Auto-configured for containers |

> **üìù Note**: Event configuration (`EVENT_NAME`, `EVENT_START_DATE`, etc.) has been **moved to the admin interface** at `/admin`. Environment variables are no longer needed for event setup!

### Development Workflow

The development environment provides:

- **Backend**: TypeScript compilation and Node.js restart on file changes
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with instant browser updates  
- **Database**: Persistent PostgreSQL data across container restarts
- **Environment**: Changes to `.env` require container restart (`make restart`)

## üìà Data Collection

The bot collects the following data every 2 minutes:
- Total member count
- Online member count
- Games being played and player counts

Real-time event tracking:
- Individual game session start/end times (immediate via Discord presence events)
- Member join/leave events (immediate)

All data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.

### Discord API Rate Limits & Performance

**Current Optimized Settings:**
- **Stats Collection**: Every 2 minutes (down from 5 minutes)
- **Dashboard Updates**: Every 15 seconds (down from 30 seconds)  
- **Game Activity**: Real-time via Discord events (no polling)

**Discord Rate Limits:**
- Guild data fetching: ~50 requests per 10 seconds per bot
- We use only 1-2 API calls every 2 minutes, well within limits
- Presence data is received via WebSocket events (real-time, no rate limit)

**Further Optimizations Possible:**
- Could reduce to 1 minute intervals if needed (still within rate limits)
- Real-time presence events ensure immediate game tracking
- Member join/leave events are also real-time

## üéØ Assembly Summer 2025

This project is specifically designed for the Assembly summer 2025 event. The dashboard features Assembly-themed styling and is optimized for tracking gaming communities during the event.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not responding:**
- Check that the bot token is correct
- Verify the bot has been invited to your server
- Ensure the bot has the required permissions

**Web dashboard not loading:**
- Check that port 3000 is not being used by another application
- Verify the bot is running without errors
- Check the console for any error messages

**No data showing:**
- Wait a few minutes for the bot to collect initial data
- Check that users are online and playing games
- Verify the Discord server ID is correct

### Platform-Specific Issues

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### Windows WSL Issues
```bash
# If you get permission errors:
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/project

# If builds are slow, the Makefile automatically applies WSL optimizations
# including Docker BuildKit settings
```

#### macOS Issues
```bash
# If containers don't start:
docker system prune -f
make build

# The Makefile automatically detects Apple Silicon and applies ARM64 optimizations
```

#### Windows (without WSL) Issues
```cmd
REM If port 3000 is in use:
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
REM Kill the process using the port

REM For better performance, consider using WSL:
wsl --install
```

#### Linux Issues
```bash
# If you get permission errors:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Then logout and login again

# If builds fail with memory errors:
docker system prune -f
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For WSL Users
- Use named volumes (already configured)
- BuildKit optimizations are applied automatically by the Makefile
- Store project files in WSL filesystem, not Windows

#### For Apple Silicon Users
- Multi-arch builds are handled automatically by the Makefile
- ARM64 optimizations are applied automatically via platform detection

#### For All Platforms
- Use `make prod` for production deployment with nginx
- Monitor with `make status` and `make logs`
- Regular backups with `make backup`

### Logs

The bot outputs detailed logs to help with debugging:
- `‚úÖ` Success messages
- `üìä` Statistics collection
- `üéÆ` Game activity changes
- `‚ùå` Error messages
